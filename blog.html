          <h2>Article 1</h2>
          <p>The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote his gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other, occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains. But, at his superior's introduction of him to Ahab, he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain's bidding.</p>

          <p>"It was a shocking bad wound," began the whale-surgeon; "and, taking my advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy&mdash;"</p>

          <p>"Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship," interrupted the one-armed captain, addressing Ahab; "go on, boy."</p>

          <h2>Article 2</h2>
          <p>"Going to string 'em," was the response.</p>

          <p>The three boys were now hard at it; and quite a knocking and hammering  arose, in which Granser babbled on unnoticed.</p>

          <p>"You are true savages. Already has begun the custom of wearing human  teeth. In another generation you will be perforating your noses and  ears and wearing ornaments of bone and shell. I know. The human race  is doomed to sink back farther and farther into the primitive night  ere again it begins its bloody climb upward to civilization. When we  increase and feel the lack of room, we will proceed to kill one another.  And then I suppose you will wear human scalp-locks at your waist, as  well&mdash;as you, Edwin, who are the gentlest of my grandsons, have already  begun with that vile pigtail. Throw it away, Edwin, boy; throw it away."</p>

          <p>"What a gabble the old geezer makes," Hare-Lip remarked, when, the teeth  all extracted, they began an attempt at equal division.</p>
