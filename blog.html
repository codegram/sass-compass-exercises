          <h2>Article 1</h2>
          <p>The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote his gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other, occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains. But, at his superior's introduction of him to Ahab, he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain's bidding.</p>

          <p>"It was a shocking bad wound," began the whale-surgeon; "and, taking my advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy&mdash;"</p>

          <p>"Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship," interrupted the one-armed captain, addressing Ahab; "go on, boy."</p>

          <p>"Going to string 'em," was the response.</p>

          <p>The three boys were now hard at it; and quite a knocking and hammering  arose, in which Granser babbled on unnoticed.</p>

          <p>"You are true savages. Already has begun the custom of wearing human  teeth. In another generation you will be perforating your noses and  ears and wearing ornaments of bone and shell. I know. The human race  is doomed to sink back farther and farther into the primitive night  ere again it begins its bloody climb upward to civilization. When we  increase and feel the lack of room, we will proceed to kill one another.  And then I suppose you will wear human scalp-locks at your waist, as  well&mdash;as you, Edwin, who are the gentlest of my grandsons, have already  begun with that vile pigtail. Throw it away, Edwin, boy; throw it away."</p>

          <p>"What a gabble the old geezer makes," Hare-Lip remarked, when, the teeth  all extracted, they began an attempt at equal division.</p>

          <p>The three boys were now hard at it; and quite a knocking and hammering  arose, in which Granser babbled on unnoticed.</p>

          <p>Perry was on his knees, praying.  I stooped and picked up a small stone.  At my movement the beast veered off a bit and commenced circling us.  Evidently it had been a target for stones before.  The ape-things were dancing up and down urging the brute on with savage cries, until at last, seeing that I did not throw, he charged us.</p>

          <p>At Andover, and later at Yale, I had pitched on winning ball teams.  My speed and control must both have been above the ordinary, for I made such a record during my senior year at college that overtures were made to me in behalf of one of the great major-league teams; but in the tightest pitch that ever had confronted me in the past I had never been in such need for control as now.</p>

          <p>As I wound up for the delivery, I held my nerves and muscles under absolute command, though the grinning jaws were hurtling toward me at terrific speed.  And then I let go, with every ounce of my weight and muscle and science in back of that throw.  The stone caught the hyaenodon full upon the end of the nose, and sent him bowling over upon his back.</p>

          <p>"And suppose it is the arena," I continued; "what then?"</p>

          <p>"You saw the two who met the tarag and the thag the time that you escaped?" he said.</p>

          <p>"Yes."</p>

          <p>"Your end in the arena would be similar to what was intended for them," he explained, "though of course the same kinds of animals might not be employed."</p>

          <h2>Article 7</h2>
          <p>The Sioux were armed with guns, from which came the reports, to which the passengers, who were almost all armed, responded by revolver-shots.</p>

          <p>The Indians had first mounted the engine, and half stunned the engineer and stoker with blows from their muskets.  A Sioux chief, wishing to stop the train, but not knowing how to work the regulator, had opened wide instead of closing the steam-valve, and the locomotive was plunging forward with terrific velocity.</p>

          <p>The Sioux had at the same time invaded the cars, skipping like enraged monkeys over the roofs, thrusting open the doors, and fighting hand to hand with the passengers.  Penetrating the baggage-car, they pillaged it, throwing the trunks out of the train.  The cries and shots were constant.  The travellers defended themselves bravely; some of the cars were barricaded, and sustained a siege, like moving forts, carried along at a speed of a hundred miles an hour.</p>

          <p>Aouda behaved courageously from the first.  She defended herself like a true heroine with a revolver, which she shot through the broken windows whenever a savage made his appearance.  Twenty Sioux had fallen mortally wounded to the ground, and the wheels crushed those who fell upon the rails as if they had been worms.  Several passengers, shot or stunned, lay on the seats.</p>
